Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications in the Python Language. It gives developers flexibility and is an accessible framework for new developers because you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file. Flask is also extensible and doesnâ€™t force a particular directory structure or require complicated boilerplate code before getting started.
